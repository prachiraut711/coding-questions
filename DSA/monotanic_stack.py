# MONOTANIC INCRESING STACK -A Monotonically Increasing Stack is a stack where elements are placed in increasing order from the bottom to the top. Example: 1, 3, 10, 15, 17

# Initialize an empty stack.
# Iterate through the elements and for each element:
# while stack is not empty AND top of stack is more than the current element
#  pop element from the stack
# Push the current element onto the stack.
# At the end of the iteration, the stack will contain the monotonic increasing order of elements.

    stack = []

    for i in nums:
        while stack and stack[-1] > i:
            stack.pop() 
        stack.append(i)
    return stack

print(monotonicIncreasing([3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6]))   #output = [1, 1, 2, 6]

# MONOTONIC DECRESING STACK: A Monotonically Decreasing Stack is a stack where elements are placed in decreasing order from the bottom to the top. Example: 17, 14, 10, 5, 1

# Start with an empty stack.
# Iterate through the elements of the input array.
# While stack is not empty AND top of stack is less than the current element:
# pop element from the stack
# Push the current element onto the stack.
# After iterating through all the elements, the stack will contain the elements in monotonic decreasing order.

#with constructed result array  (THIS IS IMP)
# üîÅ How It Works:
# You go through the array left to right.
# For each element:
# You remove any elements from the stack that are less than the current number, because they can't be the "nearest greater to the left" anymore.
# If the stack is not empty, the top element is the nearest greater to the left, so append it to result.
# If the stack is empty, it means no greater element to the left, so append -1.
# Push the current number onto the stack.

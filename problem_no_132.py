# Given a string s, find the first non-repeating character in it and return its index. If it does not exist, return -1.
# Example 1: Input: s = "leetcode"     Output: 0
# Explanation: The character 'l' at index 0 is the first character that does not occur at any other index.
# Example 2: Input: s = "loveleetcode"   Output: 2
# Example 3: Input: s = "aabb"     Output: -1

# This loop iterates over the string s again, but this time it uses enumerate to get both:

# index: The current character's position in the string.
# char: The current character itself.
# For each character:

# Check if its count in char_count is 1 (meaning it is unique).
# If so, return the index of that character, because itâ€™s the first unique character.

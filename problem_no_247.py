# 38.Write a program for Maximum profit by buying and selling a share at most k times(***)
#188. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock IV
# You are given an integer array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day, and an integer k.

# Find the maximum profit you can achieve. You may complete at most k transactions: i.e. you may buy at most k times and sell at most k times.

# Note: You may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).
# Example 1:

# Input: k = 2, prices = [2,4,1]
# Output: 2
# Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 2) and sell on day 2 (price = 4), profit = 4-2 = 2.
# Example 2:

# Input: k = 2, prices = [3,2,6,5,0,3]
# Output: 7
# Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 2) and sell on day 3 (price = 6), profit = 6-2 = 4. Then buy on day 5 (price = 0) and sell on day 6 (price = 3), profit = 3-0 = 3.

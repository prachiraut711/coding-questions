# Given two arrays of strings list1 and list2, find the common strings with the least index sum.
# A common string is a string that appeared in both list1 and list2.
# A common string with the least index sum is a common string such that if it appeared at list1[i] and list2[j] then i + j should be the minimum value among all the other common strings.
# Return all the common strings with the least index sum. Return the answer in any order.
# Example 1: Input: list1 = ["Shogun","Tapioca Express","Burger King","KFC"], list2 = ["Piatti","The Grill at Torrey Pines","Hungry Hunter Steakhouse","Shogun"]
# Output: ["Shogun"]
# Explanation: The only common string is "Shogun".
# Example 2: Input: list1 = ["Shogun","Tapioca Express","Burger King","KFC"], list2 = ["KFC","Shogun","Burger King"]
# Output: ["Shogun"]
# Explanation: The common string with the least index sum is "Shogun" with index sum = (0 + 1) = 1.
# Example 3: Input: list1 = ["happy","sad","good"], list2 = ["sad","happy","good"]
# Output: ["sad","happy"]
# Explanation: There are three common strings:
# "happy" with index sum = (0 + 1) = 1.
# "sad" with index sum = (1 + 0) = 1.
# "good" with index sum = (2 + 2) = 4.
# The strings with the least index sum are "sad" and "happy".

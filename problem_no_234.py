#25. word wrap code.(leetcode text justify problem)

# Given an array of strings words and a width maxWidth, format the text such that each line has exactly maxWidth characters and is fully (left and right) justified.

# You should pack your words in a greedy approach; that is, pack as many words as you can in each line. Pad extra spaces ' ' when necessary so that each line has exactly maxWidth characters.

# Extra spaces between words should be distributed as evenly as possible. If the number of spaces on a line does not divide evenly between words, the empty slots on the left will be assigned more spaces than the slots on the right.

# For the last line of text, it should be left-justified, and no extra space is inserted between words.

# Note:

# A word is defined as a character sequence consisting of non-space characters only.
# Each word's length is guaranteed to be greater than 0 and not exceed maxWidth.
# The input array words contains at least one word.
 

# Example 1:

# Input: words = ["This", "is", "an", "example", "of", "text", "justification."], maxWidth = 16
# Output:
# [
#    "This    is    an",
#    "example  of text",
#    "justification.  "
# ]
# Example 2:

# Input: words = ["What","must","be","acknowledgment","shall","be"], maxWidth = 16
# Output:
# [
#   "What   must   be",
#   "acknowledgment  ",
#   "shall be        "
# ]
# Explanation: Note that the last line is "shall be    " instead of "shall     be", because the last line must be left-justified instead of fully-justified.
# Note that the second line is also left-justified because it contains only one word.
# Example 3:

# Input: words = ["Science","is","what","we","understand","well","enough","to","explain","to","a","computer.","Art","is","everything","else","we","do"], maxWidth = 20
# Output:
# [
#   "Science  is  what we",
#   "understand      well",
#   "enough to explain to",
#   "a  computer.  Art is",
#   "everything  else  we",
#   "do                  "
# ]

# Nice â€” letâ€™s zoom in on that exact block and unpack every detail, using the first example so itâ€™s concrete.

# The code you asked about
# line = ""
# for i in range(len(line_words)):
#     line += line_words[i]
#     if i < len(line_words) - 1:
#         line += " " * (space_between + (1 if i < extra else 0))
# result.append(line)

# What the variables mean (right before this block runs)

# line_words â€” list of words collected for this line.
# Example (first line): ["This", "is", "an"].

# line_len â€” total number of characters in those words (no spaces). For ["This","is","an"] â†’ 4 + 2 + 2 = 8.

# spaces = maxWidth - line_len â€” total spaces we must add to reach maxWidth. For maxWidth=16 â†’ spaces = 16 - 8 = 8.

# space_between = spaces // (len(line_words)-1) â€” base spaces to put in each gap. Here 8 // 2 = 4.

# extra = spaces % (len(line_words)-1) â€” leftover spaces that must be distributed to the leftmost gaps. Here 8 % 2 = 0.

# So before the loop we have:

# line_words = ["This","is","an"]

# space_between = 4

# extra = 0

# Step-by-step iteration (first example)

# Start: line = "".

# i = 0

# line += line_words[0] â†’ line = "This"

# i < len(line_words)-1? â†’ 0 < 2 â†’ True, so we add spaces:

# amount = space_between + (1 if i < extra else 0)

# = 4 + (1 if 0 < 0 else 0) = 4 + 0 = 4

# line += " " * 4 â†’ line = "This " (4 spaces after This)

# i = 1

# line += line_words[1] â†’ line = "This is"

# i < len(line_words)-1? â†’ 1 < 2 â†’ True

# amount = 4 + (1 if 1 < 0 else 0) = 4

# line += " " * 4 â†’ line = "This is "

# i = 2

# line += line_words[2] â†’ line = "This is an"

# i < len(line_words)-1? â†’ 2 < 2 â†’ False â†’ do not add spaces after the last word.

# After the loop, result.append(line) adds "This is an" to the result.

# Key points shown by this trace

# Spaces are only added between words, never after the last word (thatâ€™s why we check i < len(line_words)-1).

# space_between is the base number of spaces for every gap.

# extra leftover spaces (if any) are given to the leftmost gaps by the (1 if i < extra else 0) term.

# Example where extra > 0 (to illustrate the (1 if i < extra else 0) behavior)

# Suppose we need spaces = 3 with 2 gaps (3 // 2 = 1, 3 % 2 = 1) â€” this happens for ["example","of","text"]:

# space_between = 1, extra = 1.

# Gaps become: first gap = 1 + 1 = 2 spaces, second gap = 1 + 0 = 1 space.

# Iteration:

# i=0 â†’ add "example", then add 2 spaces â†’ "example "

# i=1 â†’ add "of", then add 1 space â†’ "example of "

# i=2 â†’ add "text", no trailing spaces â†’ "example of text"

# This is how the algorithm ensures leftmost gaps get the extra spaces.

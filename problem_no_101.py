# Given an array nums. We define a running sum of an array as runningSum[i] = sum(nums[0]â€¦nums[i]). Return the running sum of nums.
# Example 1: Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]    Output: [1,3,6,10]
# Explanation: Running sum is obtained as follows: [1, 1+2, 1+2+3, 1+2+3+4].
# Example 2: Input: nums = [1,1,1,1,1]   Output: [1,2,3,4,5]
# Explanation: Running sum is obtained as follows: [1, 1+1, 1+1+1, 1+1+1+1, 1+1+1+1+1].
# Example 3: Input: nums = [3,1,2,10,1]  Output: [3,4,6,16,17]
